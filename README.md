#### DATA SET INFORMATION
The data set allows for several new combinations of attributes and attribute exclusions, or the modification of the attribute type (categorical, integer, or real) depending on the purpose of the research.The data set (Absenteeism at work - Part I) was used in academic research at the Universidade Nove de Julho - Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management.

#### ATTRIBUTE INFORMATION

## OBJECTIVES

The purpose of this notebook is to collect data for exploratory data analysis.

Formulate the data by compiling and divided the data into two, namely categorical data and continuous data. That makes it easier to visualize.


## PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON

### DATA PREPARATION
- Import Dataset from Kaggle
- Import Libraries

### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
- Check Dimensions of data
- Check Data type for each attribute
- Check Null values in dataset
- Check Correlation. The most common method for calculating correlation is Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient, that assumes a normal distribution of the attributes involved. A correlation of -1 or 1 shows a full negative or positive correlation respectively. Whereas a value of 0 shows no correlation at all. The matrix lists all attributes across the top and down the side, to give correlation between all pairs of attributes (twice, because the matrix is symmetrical). There can show the diagonal line through the matrix from the top left to bottom right corners of the matrix shows perfect correlation of each attribute with itself.
- The skew result show a positive (right) or negative (left) skew. Values closer to zeroshow less skew.
- Add categorical target column as per project requires 
- Formatting to proper data type
- Store two datasets, one for continous and other categorical

## RESULTS

![1](visualization/1.png)



```
Education Categories

1  High School
2  Graduate 
3  Postgraduate 
4  Master and Doctor

```
From the plot, it can show that the high school category has the highest score for undisciplined. Then the ranking is followed by the postgraduate education category.

___

```
Day of the week categories

2  Monday 
3  Tuesday 
4  Wednesday 
5  Thursday 
6  Friday
```
Mostly, the undiscipline numbers come from the day of the week. 

___

![3](visualization/3.png)


```
Absenteeism categories

Group 0 		0-20 hours
Group 1 		21-40 hours
Group 2 		41-60 hours
Group 3 		61-80 hours
Group 4 		81-100 hours
Group 5 		101-120 hours
```

Group 0, which has an absence time of 0 to 20 hours, is a group dominated by social drinkers active.


____

![4](visualization/4.png)

Followup is the attribute result of the absence reason category aggregation. The NoFollowup is an attribute without reasons for absence.
From the line plot, that appears that absence is in the category attribute of reasons for absences.

____

![5](visualization/5.png)

The average number of absentee numbers fluctuates with the achievement of a company's target. The lowest number of target achievements is the percentage of less than 80.

____

![6](visualization/6.png)

Based on this graph, the highest absenteeism is between 15 hours and 20 hours of service time.

____

![7](visualization/7.png)

The highest mean number of absences per hour found among employees with three children.

____

![8](visualization/8.png)

The 50-59 year age group has the highest number of hours of absenteeism amongst others.
